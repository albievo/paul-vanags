            I am a PhD researcher at the University of Birmingham, studying prosocial behaviour in humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gained my first degree in chemistry from Oxford University. After this I had a 25 year career in commerical marketing, followed by NGO fundraising, including 10 years at Oxfam GB. During this part of my career, I became interested in why people are more or less inclined to help others, and I decided to follow this interest into academic research.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have Masters degrees in Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Social Science Research, and multiple academic awards. My PhD research is focused on prosocial decision making in group contexts.
