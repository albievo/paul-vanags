            I am a PhD researcher at the University of Birmingham, studying the neural and computational basis of prosocial behaviour. My research examines how and why people choose to help others, particularly in group contexts.

            My academic journey began with a degree in Chemistry from Oxford University. I then spent over two decades outside academia, developing functional and leadership skills in commercial marketing and NGO fundraising, including roles as Head of Fundraising at Oxfam and Director at War Child. This experience deepened my interest in how prosocial behaviour manifests in real-world settings, sparking a broader curiosity about its underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms. This led me to transition back into academia, earning Masterâ€™s degrees in Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Social Science Research, along with multiple academic awards. I am now in the final year of my PhD, focusing on two key aspects of human prosociality.

            Beyond my primary research, I am particularly interested in how prosociality is conceptualised and measured in scientific studies, and how clearer, more consistent categorisation could advance the field. My work is driven by a commitment to bridging research and real-world impact.

            Outside academia, I have held advisory and board roles with organisations such as the Institute of Fundraising, Rogare (the Fundraising Think Tank), Oxfam Sweden, and Think Global, and I have been a regular speaker at industry conferences
